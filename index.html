    <h1>Simply... Art</h1>
        <h2>Our Mission:</h2>
        <h2>Supporting small artists and their creativity, no middle man, no hidden fees. Providing informational videos/steps/instruction on how you can create your own art at home, and connecting clients with art mentors. We also would love to support new artists and their work, inspired and created by this website.</h2>

    <h1>I'd like to tell you about our goals!</h1>  
            <p>1. Help customers and clients get in contact directly with their artist of choice.</p>
            <p>2. Provide direct links to informational videos, DIY's, and artist starter packs.</p>
            <p>3. Ensure that all proceeds go directly to the Artist without unnecessary fees.</p>
            <p>4. Support new upcoming artists from all skill-level and backgrounds to be the best artist they can be!</p>
		<hr>
		
    <h2>Our vision and inspiration:</h2>        
        <p>1. Inspired by <a href="https://www.artfinder.com/#/">Art Finder</a></p>
            <a href="https://www.artfinder.com/#/"><img src="images/art-finder.png" alt="Art Finder Example" width = "700" height = "250"></a>
                <p> 1a.) We appreciate the way you can easily find artists near the bottom of their webpage, along with snippets of their work. After the boxes identifying individual artists with previews of their work you will see categories for gift ideas, which I also would like to incoorporate.</p>

        <p>2. Loosely inspired by <a href="https://www.etsy.com/?utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_term=etsy_e&utm_campaign=Search_US_Brand_BNG_General-Brand_Core_All_HP_Exact&utm_ag=A1&utm_custom1=_k_be35b1ca2cda14092007d0f30a519d3c_k_&utm_content=bing_131876476_2730742026_81638813116376_kwd-38923007297:loc-190_c_&utm_custom2=131876476&msclkid=be35b1ca2cda14092007d0f30a519d3c">Etsy</a>, without the anxiety.</p>
            <a href="https://www.etsy.com/?utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_term=etsy_e&utm_campaign=Search_US_Brand_BNG_General-Brand_Core_All_HP_Exact&utm_ag=A1&utm_custom1=_k_be35b1ca2cda14092007d0f30a519d3c_k_&utm_content=bing_131876476_2730742026_81638813116376_kwd-38923007297:loc-190_c_&utm_custom2=131876476&msclkid=be35b1ca2cda14092007d0f30a519d3c"><img src="images/etsy-example.png" alt="Etsy Categories Example" width = "700" height = "200"></a>
                <p>2a.) Personally I am no longer quite a fan of Etsy since they began pushing advertisements at the expense of the artist - though I will admit that I have always appreciated the organizational circular tabs near the top of the website. I am also a fan of the color scheme they choose to use for their website, it is both relaxing an enough to catch your eye.</p>

    <p>
        <h1>Content...? Tons!</h1>
        <h2>4 tabs for peace of mind</h2>
        <h2>Anticipated additional website tabs include:</h2>
            <p>1. Organized page dedicated to exposing self-made artists, their portfolios, inspiration styles, and contact information.</p>
            <p>2. Full informational page dedicated to artist-made self starter DIY kits with instructional videos, and DIY videos/links for visual learners.</p>
            <p>3. A comment/postings forum to communicate directly with the artist and other customers with questions or artistic advice, as well as offering/seeking mentorship.</p>
            <p>4. Full page dedicated to postings of art created by customers/clientel to show reviews, improvement of skill, and possibly helping them become content creators themselves and add to the page with their own small craft business.</p>

    <p>
        <h1>Who is our target audience you may ask..?</h1>
            <p>Our ideal audience would include anybody interested in supporting small self-made artists, looking to buy any handmade gifts, wishing to get into crafting themselves but don't know where to start, or even anyone just looking for a mentor in the art world to help improve and better themselves and their work.</p>
